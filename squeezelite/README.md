Run Squeezelite player on your home assistant system

## What you need

The Home Assistant Squeezelite add-on allows you to run a Squeezelite player local on your home assistant machine. \
Squeezelite requires a Squeezebox server in your network to be seen, not included. \
Please visit [Logitech](https://mysqueezebox.com/download) to install the server (if required).
